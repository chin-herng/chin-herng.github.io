About Me
========

I was born (at a very young age) in Malaysia in 2003. I picked up C++ during secondary school, and got very interested in mathematics and coding. Prior to being admitted into NUS, I spend a lot of time taking part in mathematical and informatics olympiads. I was in the Malaysian team in Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad (APIO) 2021. As an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science, I developed strong interests towards theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics, and found passion in teaching as a meaningful activity that coincidentally lies within my capabilities.

Outside of academics, I enjoy unforced writing (writing but not for the sake of assignments) as a medium to express my thoughts. I also think a lot about mental wellness and how to cope with things like stress and self-doubt in university. I am a big fan of learning new things and acquiring new skills. I like the idea of iteratively exploring stuff outside of my comfort zone only to end up expanding it. It suffices to say that I find myself cultivating a wide array of hobbies and interests which will be covered in my blogs.
