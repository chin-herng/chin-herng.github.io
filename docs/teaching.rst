Teaching
========

.. note::

   I heavily adapted the layout of this page from `Dr. Eric Han's personal website <https://eric-han.com/teaching>`_. He was my tutor for *CS2109S Introduction to AI and Machine Learning* and he is also a very inspiring educator.

I have been an undergraduate teaching assistant (TA) for two courses per semester since my sophomore year. This means that I host weekly tutorial/laboratory sessions with a class size of less than 20 students for at least twice a week. These sessions usually involve a recap on lecture contents followed by a discussion on an assigned worksheet. I also contribute/check/grade assignment/exam questions as well as invigilate examinations to make sure no one is doing anything nasty.

My main goal as a TA is to help students learn. It is important to emphasize that I am not here to help them optimize their grades, but rather to help them learn the materials and develop a genuine interest in the subject. I do not assume that a good understanding of the subject will naturally translate to better grades, for there are many other factors that can affect a student's performance in an exam, but at the end of the day what benefits students in the long run is their solid understanding of the subject, not their grades. I share the same values in my own learning.

Teaching Feedback
-----------------

Over the years I have received many kind words from my students, which I am very grateful for. Here is one feedback from each of the courses I have taught in the past two semesters:

    "I could tell that he's extremely passionate about teaching right from the first tutorial! He's also extremely clear with his explanations, skipping basic concepts while spending sufficient time breaking down more complex ideas and the thought process behind how to devise various algos :) Overall super duper chill and friendly ta that I can approach if I have any doubts! I'm not the biggest fan of 2040s but he really makes it a lot more enjoyable yay"

    "Chin Herng is very supportive to provide insightful comments on how to solve hard problems easily with clear explaination of the logic behind his explaination. I can learn the concepts fast through his clear and patient explaination. Morever, he is helpful and kind to provide extra consultation even though it is midterm period. Thanks for his consultation, I can learn discrete math much easier."

    "TA Chin Herng provided timely responses to my questions, even outside of CS2040S (help with understanding solutions to OA questions about topics such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming). He is also passionate and definitely knowledgeable about theoretical computer science, and DSA. He is approachable and i think he put a lot of thought into how to structure his labs and help us understand each topic. Despite his likely also buys schedule, he goes out of his way to provide explanations and examples, further than what was asked, showing his care for student's development and learning."
